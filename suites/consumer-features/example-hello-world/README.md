This is a very basic Pact example, demonstrating the simplest use of a Pact Consumer

## Mock provider setup

To create a Pact, we first need to define a relationship between Consumer and Provider.

This gives a mock Provider, which our Consumer can interact with.

<!-- Annotated code block - Setting up the mock Provider -->

## Pact creation

Each Pact is declared in a "given, when, then" style.

Following the "arrange, act, assert" pattern, we:

- arrange the expected interactions
- act on the consumer to perform the interaction
- assert that the mock provider received the specific interaction

## Something else

Some other code snippets would go here when we have some
